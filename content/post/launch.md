 # Launch time

Welcome all the interwebz. I've decided for the _nth_ time to start a coding blog. I hope this time I will persist in this endeavor. I plan to write about fun coding stuff.

Few words about me. My name is _≈Åukasz Kwoska_. I have been a developer for many years. Mostly mobile developer, but I am interested in all kinds of _graphics_, _audio_ and _algorithmic_ stuff.
